<p><b> Back-end Engineer (intern), Jiayun Data Science and Technology, Hangzhou, 2015.05 - 2015.07 </b></p>
<ul>
<li> Used Spring MVC framework and Hibernate for back-end development and database configuration of an e-Business Platform
<li> Used Jmeter to generate automated testing scripts for POST request and response testing
</ul>

<H2>Research</H2>
<p><b> Guided Research in IS, Singapore Management University, Singapore, 2015.09 - 2015.11 </b></p>
<ul>
<li> Implemented two index structures (Clustered Pivot Tables, Extreme Pivots), two query algorithms (Range, kNN) for Metric Space Similarity Qeury (C++)
<li> Changed three index structures (CPT, EP, M-tree) to external storage index algorithms for more fair comparison
</ul>
<p><b> Research on Experimental Evaluation for Pivot-based Metric Indexes, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 2016.03 - 2016.05 </b></p>
<ul>
<li> Experiment on ten index structures with Range and kNN query and different types of dataset (vector, string, set)
<li> Improved query performance by replacing Pivots Selecting Algorithms of two index structures (EP, VPT)
<li> Compared index building cost and query performance, in terms of running time, distance computations, index size and I/O times (for external storage algorithms)
</ul>

<H2>Project</H2>
<ul>
<li> Implemented the Crawler, Tokenizer, Stemmer, Indexer and Corrector part of a search engine built for Fox Sports NBA news and players profile (Java, 2014) 
<li> Designed the Activities logic of a GPS-based real-time bus station reminder App and undertook the real-time locating and destination detection part (Android, 2014) 
<li> Implemented the Interpreter, Catalog Manager and Buffer Manager part of a mini database systems, in support of all basic standard SQL queries (C++, 2014)
<li> Wrote the Administrator Control Panel part of a Campus Forum System, to manage the boards and posts in the forum, as well as users' privilege (PHP + MySQL, 2015) 
<li> Undertook the data collection and processing on Arduino of a Smart Insole Program, and designed a gait pattern detection algorithm to trigger specific tasks on PC (C + Python, 2015)
<li> Exploiting Buffer Overflow vulnerability on open source software and perform Return-to-libc attack to print out specific variables (Assembly + C, 2015)
</ul>
